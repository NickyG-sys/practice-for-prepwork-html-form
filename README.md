HTML Forms Overview
Eventually, you'll want to have people send information to your applications so that you can send them stuff or get their opinions. You will do this by creating an HTML form. In this lesson, you will:

Design a simple form
Implement it using the right HTML form controls and other HTML elements

Getting started
Open up your terminal. Change the present working directory to your home directory.
Make a new directory in your home directory named "html-form".
Change the present working directory into "html-form".
Start Visual Studio Code by running the command code . from the terminal in the "html-form" directory.
Create a new file.
Type the following HTML code into it.The form's design
Before starting to code anything with a visual element, it's always better to step back and take the time to think about what it will look like, and how people will use it. Designing a quick mock-up will help you to define the right set of data you want to ask people for. From an interactive experience point of view, it's important to remember that the bigger your form, the more you risk losing users. Keep it simple and stay focused: ask only for that data you absolutely need.

In this, you will build a simple "add a user" form. It will look like this.

Form
